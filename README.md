## What's it all about?
This is the first website that I designed and developed from scratch. My goal was to create a clean and consitent design and learn a lot along the way. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to position elements on a page with grid, create and deploy svgs, and use animations and effects to create visual appeal.

## Process

1.	Design the website 
2.  Develop the website layout
3.  Add and format content to the website
4.  Refine the content and layout
5.  Publish the website on netlify
