## What's it all about?
This is the first website that I designed and developed from scratch. My goal was to create a clean and consitent design and learn a lot along the way. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to position elements on a page with grid, create and deploy svgs, and use animations and effects to create visual appeal.

## Process

1.	Design the website 
2.  Develop the website layout
3.  Add and format content to the website
4.  Refine the content and layout
5.  Publish the website on netlify

### Design the website
The website was designed on figma. It was the first time I used the tool but it was easy to pick up and turned out to be a fantastic tool. I will definately be using it again.

I began by looking for design inspiration. I eventually settled on the 'art deco' style. I liked the clean lines and it seemed dooable for someone with limited design/svg-creation experience. My goal was to create an art-deco style website that didn't look too dated.

I began be wanyting to create four distinct sections in my website; one for a homepage, projects section, skills section and contact me section. I found four different art-deco colour themes to base each section on. I liked that each colour theme used different shades of the same colour. I also really like that the colours were pastel shades that are easy on the eyes. 

Next was the text. Google fonts had a lot art-deco style fonts but only liked one. I used that font throughout the site, except for the menu-bar and section headings. I styled the menu bar and headings on menus in video games that had an art-deco style.

Creating and finding the SVGs was the hardest part of designing the website. This was a big limiting factor in my design. I had some ideas I couldn't deploy because I couldn't find or create the shapes that I wanted. Thankfully there are a lot of open-source SVGs out there I could use. I eneded up using SVGs for all the icons and the city-scape. I created the corner decorations and spotligts.

After a lot of trial and error, I abandoned the idea of using four different colour themes. It didn't look great. I reduced the numer of sections from four to three and stuck to two different colour schemes. This looked cleaner and it saved me a lot of time.

I eventually settled on a design that I liked and could start coding!

### Develop the website layout
I've tried to create one other website before and I remember having a hard time laying out the website the way I wanted to. So this time I wanted to completely create the layout first before adding any content.

I used grid to place my divs because it was the tool I was most familiar and comfortable with using. It ended up being very easy to use. I was able to finish the initial layout in a short time. I could place all my divs where I wanted to and it was easy to change the pllacement of each div.

### Add and format content to the website
Next was filling out each of the divs with content. I began by adding in the svgs because I expected them to be the most challenging type of content to add. I was right. The biggest problem was getting the svgs the right size and getting them to scale when the browser size changed.

### Refine the content and layout

### Publish the website on netlify
