# Context
This was my first attempt at creating my portfolio website. I have since created a new portfolio website at [maximerrillees.com](http://www.maximerrillees.com/).


# [Maxi Merrillees profile website](https://maxi-merrillees.netlify.com/)

## What's it all about?
This is the first website that I designed and developed from scratch. My goal was to create a clean and consistent design and learn a lot along the way. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to position elements on a page with grid, create and deploy SVGs, and use animations and effects to create visual appeal.

## Process

1.	Design the website 
2.  Develop the website layout
3.  Add and format content to the website
4.  Refine the content and layout
5.  Publish the website on netlify

### Design the website
The website was designed on figma. It was the first time I used the tool but it was easy to pick up and turned out to be a fantastic tool. I will definitely be using it again.

I began by looking for design inspiration. I eventually settled on the 'art deco' style. I liked the clean lines and it seemed doable for someone with limited design/SVG-creation experience. My goal was to create an art-deco style website that didn't look too dated.

I began be wanting to create four distinct sections in my website; one for a homepage, projects section, skills section and contact me section. I found four different art-deco colour themes to base each section on. I liked that each colour theme used different shades of the same colour. I also really like that the colours were pastel shades that are easy on the eyes.

Next was the text. Google fonts had a lot of art-deco style fonts but only liked one. I used that font throughout the site, except for the menu-bar and section headings. I styled the menu bar and headings on menus in video games that had an art-deco style.

Creating and finding the SVGs was the hardest part of designing the website. This was a big limiting factor in my design. I had some ideas I couldn't deploy because I couldn't find or create the shapes that I wanted. Thankfully there are a lot of open-source SVGs out there I could use. I ended up using SVGs for all the icons and the city-scape. I created the corner decorations and spotlights.

After a lot of trial and error, I abandoned the idea of using four different colour themes. It didn't look great. I reduced the number of sections from four to three and stuck to two different colour schemes. This looked cleaner and it saved me a lot of time.

I eventually settled on a design that I liked and could start coding!

### Develop the website layout
I've tried to create one other website before and I remember having a hard time laying out the website the way I wanted to. So this time I wanted to completely create the layout first before adding any content.

I used grid to place my divs because it was the tool I was most familiar and comfortable with using. It ended up being very easy to use. I was able to finish the initial layout in a short time. I could place all my divs where I wanted to and it was easy to change the placement of each div.

### Add and format content to the website
Next was filling out each of the divs with content. I began by adding in the SVGs because I expected them to be the most challenging type of content to add. I was right. The biggest problem was getting the SVGs the right size and getting them to scale when the browser size changed. 

I tried many different display types, position types, and ways of placing content within the container. After a lot of trial and error, I eventually managed to get the SVGs to the right size and position but none of them scaled with the browser perfectly but it looked good when displayed on a full browser page and a mobile phone so that was good enough for a first try. Also, I had other things to do and a limited amount of time so I had to move on.

Next was adding in the text. Adding the text through index.html was easy but positioning the text within each container was a challenge. Like with the SVGs, I had a hard time positioning the text in the right place within each container. I eventually got everything to where I wanted it to be through trial and error. By this point, it became clear to me that I need to develop a much better understanding of the different display and positioning options. But that's for another time. It looks okay for now and I needed to move on.

The last thing to add was the menu bar. I went through many different design iterations with regards to placement and functionality. I couldn't implement some of those designs because I didn't know how to display and position them the way I wanted. I eventually settlled on a design that I could implement - not my first choice but it looked good enough.

The form was relatively easy to add. I found a tutorial on YouTube that walked me through adding a form and I adjusted it to match my design and fit my page. 

### Refine the content and layout
This took a long time. Most of that time was spent adding the text content and positioning each element to display the way I wanted them to. I also got new ideas along the way and changed the layout accordingly. Using grid made it very easy to change the layout.

I also spent a lot of time adding in effects. I had wanted to add in a lot of effects and animations from the start. I didn't deploy most of what I wanted to do because I didn't have enough time to learn how to do it all, but I managed to add in the smooth scrolling effect and some hover effects. I'm really happy with them. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to add hover effects to SVGs. I wanted the spotlights to 'turn on' when someone hovered their mouse over them. I came close but ran out of time. Something to figure out for next time.

### Publish the website on netlify
I couldn't believe how easy this was to do. It took me less than three minutes to sign up for an account and deploy the site from my github account.

## For next time
1.  Learn how to properly use each display and positioning option. I had no problems developing the website layout but getting every element to do what I wanted within each section was a challenge.
2.  Test the website on a variety of browser magnification settings. I designed the website based on 150% magnification which is what I use. If I zoom out to 100% the design falls apart.
3.  Learn how to create SVGs. Images are important and add a lot of visual appeal to a website. I think knowing how to make basic nice-looking SVGs will go a long way.
